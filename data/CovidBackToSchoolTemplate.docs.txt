Over the summer, PublicSource reported that the number of drug overdoses and overdose deaths in Allegheny County was rising again. 

The increase started before the pandemic, but experts said the coronavirus was making the opioid epidemic worse. We reported on what the new surge in overdoses looked like from the eyes of recovery workers who were trying to adapt to the new challenges. 

And, in December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed just how widespread the recent spike in overdoses has become in the United States. In a 12-month period ending in May 2020, more than 81,000 Americans died of drug overdoses. It is the highest number ever in a one-year period. Although information on overdoses is delayed by months in Allegheny County, there are already 492 confirmed deaths in 2020 — as many as in all of 2018. 

We talked to five people in and around Allegheny County who have had to reckon with addiction during the pandemic, either because they are struggling themselves or because their loved ones have suffered through it. They shared stories of a crisis within a crisis.

(PublicSource chose not to use the last names of some people who shared their stories to protect their privacy.)

The baby has neonatal abstinence syndrome caused by her mother's cocaine addiction and spent her first four months in intensive care. When she took the baby home, Nicole had to learn to keep tabs on her oxygen levels and give her extra oxygen when the baby needed it.

There are some volunteers at the hospital who hold babies without families, Nicole said, but it’s not as consistent. The baby developed a flat head from laying too much on one side. Nicole didn’t want the baby to have to wear a helmet.

"She tended to look only one way and use toys on one side of her body,” she said.

Her physical therapists had to work remotely but they made progress, moving on to crawling and walking. And, unlike some other babies she’s had in the past, this baby bonded with her family.

In September, Nicole thought there was a chance the baby would go up for adoption, but by January it was clear that the baby was headed for reunification with her birth mother.

During the first months of the pandemic, Nicole didn’t receive many requests for fostering, she said, because many times it’s schools and daycare providers who spot abuse. But it has picked up. They fostered another child in October whose father had overdosed.

"The baby is having a difficult time transitioning back and forth between the two households,” she said of the new baby. "She constantly wants to be held and snuggled as her sense of security is now changing and her routine for the past year is being disrupted.”
